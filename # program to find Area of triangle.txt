# program to find Area of triangle

# Taking input from the user
base  = float(input("Enter the base:"))
height= float (input("Enter the height:"))

# Applying the formula
Area = 0.5*base*height

# Printing the result
print("Area of triangle is:", Area)


# Sample Output:
# Enter the base: 10
# Enter the height: 5
# Area of the triangle is: 25.0
