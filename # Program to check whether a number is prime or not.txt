# Program to check whether a number is prime or not
# A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two factors: 1 and itself

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
if num <= 1:
    print("Not a prime")

    # Check divisibility from 2 to num-1
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            # If divisible by any number, it is not prime
            print("Not a prime")
            break
    else:
        # If loop completes without break, number is prime
        print("Prime number")

# Sample output
# Enter a number: 7
# Prime number
